                  The constant pressure of chasing marks is scaling up the
                  stress among students. It being expected from every student to
                  perform exceptionally in every subject, which is measured just
                  from the scores obtained in exams. Parents often indulge in
                  comparing their ward from others on the basis of scores adding
                  to the pressure, even more, stressing furthermore than their
                  ward should outperform others. The educational institutions in
                  an attempt to cover up the gigantic syllabi, often rush up,
                  ignoring the unique learning needs of the students and leaving
                  no time for proper assimilation of the concepts delivered to
                  them. All this has led to the sudden surge in the demand of
                  ITS TUITIONS as they offer individualized attention and cater
                  to the unique needs of the learners, that too from the comfort
                  of their homes. It provides the scope of in-depth guidance and
                  mentoring of the students for effective change in the
                  performance as well as behavior.
